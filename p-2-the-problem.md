# The problem

In this exercise, we're going to try and solve an important problem in Economics using Python. 

## Objectives for this lesson

***

- Identify the problem
- Introduce the binomial distribution

## Imagine this problem

***

> You are the owner of a hotel with 100 rooms, and you would like to maximize your revenue for these rooms.  In order to determine the maximum revenue, you first need to establish what information you know about your hotel.  You take a look at the books and discovered the following information:

- You have 100 rooms in the hotel that can be sold.
- Each room costs $220 USD per night
- You know that (on an average night) 8% of your hotel guests who book a room, don't show up.  
- If overbooked, we have to place customers at another hotel, which costs us 400 USD.

Using all of this information, we need to determine how many rooms we should overbook in order to maximize expected revenue?

## Develop a game plan

***

In order to successfully solve this problem, there are a few things we'll need to learn about. First of all, we'll need to understand what it means numerically that "on average, 8% of our hotel guests don't show up". 

It turns out that you can model this with a **binomial distribution**. To understand **the binomial distribution**, an important concept in probability theory which lies at the foundation of data science, you first need to learn a little bit more about the *Bernoulli experiment**.

## Recap

***

In this lesson, we first gathered some information and with that information we were able to define our problem.  After looking at the problem, we introduced a a way to look at our problem numerically with a binomial distribution.  To understand the binomial distribution, we first need to learn a little bit more about the *Bernoulli experiment**.  In the next lesson we will look at the Bernoulli experiment and how it will help us to better understand the binomial distribution.
