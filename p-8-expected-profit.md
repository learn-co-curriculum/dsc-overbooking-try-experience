## Using Python to define Optimal numbers of rooms booked

## Objectives for this lesson

***

Since we know what the expected profit is when booking 104 rooms. Now, we'll want to do this very same analysis again for 103 rooms. And for 102 rooms and for 105 rooms! In Python, repeating the calculations for a different number of rooms is easy when you create a for loop!
